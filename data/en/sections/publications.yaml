  paper:
    summary: "Neural decoding for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) traditionally relies on spike sorting, which often suffers from inaccuracies and loss of information. Leveraging advances in high-density probes and computational methods, 
      we propose a spike sorting-free decoding method using a mixture of Gaussians to model the distribution of spike features, encoding uncertainty without clustering spikes. We allow the mixing proportion of the MoG
      to change over time in response to the behavior and develop variational inference
      methods to fit the resulting model and to perform decoding. We benchmark our
      method with an extensive suite of recordings from different animals and probe
      geometries, demonstrating that our proposed decoder can consistently outperform
      current methods based on thresholding (i.e. multi-unit activity) and spike sorting."

#     summary: "In electrophysiology, precise in vivo localization of recording sites in deep brain structures is crucial for consistent targeting in multi-day recordings and accurate deep brain stimulation. However, current approaches present their own challenges: brain atlas-guided probe insertion may be imprecise due to anatomical variability, CT or MRI scan based localization may lack the spatial resolution for subregion structures, and post hoc histology misses longitudinal information in chronic recordings. Focusing on mouse recordings, we present a learning-based automatic localizer to identify hippocampus sublayers from high-density extracellular recordings. "
