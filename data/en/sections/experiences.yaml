    # company overview
    overview: Most decoding methods require spike sorting yet current spike sorting algorithms might be inaccurate and costly. So we proposed a spike sorting free method for decoding neural recordings.
    # for decoding electrophysiological data from high density Neuropixel probes
  positions:
  - designation: Density-based neural decoding for Neuropixel recordings
    start: Jun 2022
    # don't provide end date if you are currently working there. It will be replaced by "Present"

    # give some points about what was your responsibilities at the company.
    responsibilities:
    - Modeled the uncertainty of spike assignment using dynamical MoG for spike features distribution
    - Applied variational inference to fit the resulting model and to perform decoding
    - Benchmarked using recordings from various animals and probes shows better performance
    - Drafted and presented the poster at COSYNE 2023 conference

    overview: Animal behaviors are often studied with low dimensional task variables, but advances in computer vision enable us to study animal behavior with high-dimensional videos and apply it in decoding
  positions:
  - designation: Analyze nonlinear embeddings of animal behavioral videos for decoding
    start: Jan 2022
    end: May 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Extracted nonlinear behavioral embeddings from animal videos using variational autoencoder
    - Decoded behavioral embeddings from electrophysiological recording with temporal convolution
    - Assessed decoder performance by comparing true behavior frames to reconstructed frames from predicted embeddings

    overview: Recent optogenetic advances allow us to stimulate multiple cells in quick succession. However, it is challenging to distinguish the postsynaptic current given overlapping trials from multiple cells. 
  positions:
  - designation: Neural Network denoising for optogentically invoked signals
    start: Sep 2021
    end: Jan 2022
    responsibilities:
    - Developed a NN temporal denoiser to demix current waveforms with spatio-temporal overlap
    - Ran a simulation study to test the model robustness to noise and sampling rate by synthesizing current traces under a variety of signal-to-noise regimes
    - Applied this denoising model in downstream tasks of mapping synaptic connections
